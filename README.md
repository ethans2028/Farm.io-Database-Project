# Farm.io-Database-Project

The database and web application are designed as a grocery delivery system from farms to stores. In many cases, farms ship their own products in orders directly to stores. This is made complicated through some farm franchises having multiple locations with potentially different products at location. Furthermore, contacting small farms/stores can be challenging

This project was created in conjunction with Ishan Parikh over the span of 2022 winter quarter for our CPSC 3300 course.

We wanted to make a database and web application that would:
 - Allow stores and farms in the database to easily make orders and manage them
 - Allow farms and stores to manage their information so that other users in the database can contact them easily

The web application for the Farm.io database can be found below:
