# Farm.io-Database-Project

The database and web application are designed as a grocery delivery system from farms to stores. In many cases, farms ship their own products in orders directly to stores. This is made complicated through some farm franchises having multiple locations with potentially different products at location. Furthermore, contacting small farms/stores can be challenging

We wanted to make a database and web application that would:
 - Allow stores and farms in the database to easily make orders and manage them
 - Allow farms and stores to manage their information so that other users in the database can contact them easily
